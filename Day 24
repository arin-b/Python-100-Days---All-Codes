Contents for main.py:

file = open('my_file.txt')
contents = file.read()
print(contents)
file.close()  # Every open file should ideally be closed

# but if you keep forgetting to close the file, here's another option:
with open('my_file.txt') as file_variable:
    content = file_variable.read()
    print(content)

# here, there is no need to close the file. after all indented operations are carried out, file will automatically close

with open('my_file.txt', mode='w') as file1:
    file1.write('Newline text')
# by default, txt files are opened in read-only mode. If u wish to write in the file you need to change the mode
# however, the write command will delete all previous content before writing the specified text
# but if u wish to add content without deleting old one, set mode = 'a' (append) in the open command
# if you open a non-existent file in write mode, that file will be newly created for you
# in the write command you can use formatting operators such as \n
